# Energy consumption forecasting app - Master Thesis Project
  
The thesis focused on creating a real-time forecasting app for the consumption of varius energy sensors.The forecasting was created and updated in real-time,as soon as the messages were created by the sensors.   
The software stack used was the following:

- **Mqtt protocol** to receive messages from sensors,   
- **Apache Pulsar** to stream the messages,  
- **Apache Flink** to compute forecasting,
- **PostegresSQL** database to store the data
  
The project was built in containerized environment using **Docker Desktop**.  
Below follows a detailed guide in order to recreate and test the project.

---
## Step 1: Install Mqtt Mosquitto Broker using Docker
Create a local folder named **mosquitto** with the following structure :  
- /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
- /mosquitto/config/pwfile
- /mosquitto/data
- /mosquitto/log

In mosquitto.conf file add the following **minimalistic** configuration of the container.   
```bash
allow_anonymous false
listener 1883
listener 9001
protocol websockets
persistence true
password_file /mosquitto/config/pwfile
persistence_file mosquitto.db
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
```
There are many more configurations options for the mosquitto broker and they can be reviewed here under the official [mosquitto documentation](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html).  
This folders are going to be mounted to the mosquitto container.   
Create the container using the follow docker command:
```bash
docker run -it --name mosquittoo \
-p 1884:1883 \
-p 9001:9001 \
-v PathTo/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf \
-v PathTo/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log -v C:/Users/thano/containers/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data \
-v PathTo/mosquitto/config/pwfile:/mosquitto/config/pwfile \
eclipse-mosquitto
```
*Comment: PathTo is your absolute path until mosquitto folder.*   
Once the container is up and running, access it and create a user and it's password with the following commands:  
```bash
docker exec -it mosquitto sh
mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/pwfile user1
```
With those credentials your Mqtt client will be able to communicate with the Mqtt broker.  
More details about mosquitto_passwd can be found under the official [mosquitto documentation](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_passwd-1.html). 

## Step 2: Install Apache Pulsar using Docker

Use the following command to download and start a Pulsar standalone container:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -p 6650:6650 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 1883:1883 \
  --name pulsar \
  --mount source=pulsardata,target=/pulsar/data \
  --mount source=pulsarconf,target=/pulsar/conf \
  apachepulsar/pulsar-all:4.0.3 \
  bin/pulsar standalone
```

## Step 3: Install MQTT Protocol Handler (MoP)
To install MQTT support in Pulsar, integrate the MoP (MQTT on Pulsar) protocol handler.

## Step 4: Run Apache Flink in Docker
